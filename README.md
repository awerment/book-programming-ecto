# Programming Ecto - Book follow-along

This repository is the result of following along with the [Programming Ecto](https://pragprog.com/titles/wmecto/programming-ecto/) book by [Darin Wilson](https://github.com/darinwilson) and [Eric Meadows-JÃ¶nsson](https://github.com/ericmj). Many thanks to both of them for writing the most complete material on the many use cases and features of [Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html).

I've tried adding most of the book's examples for the main `music_db` app as unit tests to the project. Some of them required changes to be able to run them with `mix text`. Here and there I've added additional checks to experiment with `ExUnit.CaptureIO`, others to validate my assumptions.
